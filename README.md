# codeigniter-bootstrap-jquery
A great startup framework based on CodeIgniter, Bootstrap, jQuery and Lighbox. I am currently using CodeIgniter 3.0.6, Bootstrap 3.3.6, jQuery 1.10.2 and ekko-lightbox. All the credit goes the authors of the mentioned piece of code. What I have done is simply joined them together so that others can easily pick it up and get going for their projects.
